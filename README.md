Home page contains 4 different designs, feel free to play around with the page width ðŸ˜‰
Home page inspire by Lynn Fisher's amazing 2017 webpage: https://lynnandtonic.com/archive/2017/

Jobs page (called "About" page for now) inspire by Vincent Humeau's tutorial: https://dev.to/vinceumo/css-3d---scrolling-on-the-z-axis-45i9 .

The website supports cross-browser, responsive, and accessibility. The theme also supports IE (against my better judgment).

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ The website have a perfect Lighthouse Audit! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ that I'm going to try to maintain as I update the site. (https://brocedesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/perfect_score_audit.png)

The design for this page follow the model shown on the following YouTube video series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jav5hPmUaUw&list=PLmfpV505N-SnLSoU2QTsb-TBmVYXT6baT
